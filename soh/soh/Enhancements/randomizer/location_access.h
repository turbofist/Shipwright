        /*
         * This logic covers checks that exist in the shared areas of MQ spirit from a glitchless standpoint.
         * This room has Quantum logic that I am currently handling with this function, however this is NOT suitable for glitch logic as it relies on specific ages
         * In this chunk there are 3 possibilities for passing a check, but first I have to talk about parallel universes.

         * In MQ Spirit key logic, we mostly care about 2 possibilities for how the player can spend keys, creating 2 Parralel universes
         * In the first universe, the player did not enter spirit as adult until after climbing as child, thus child spends keys linearly, only needing 2 to reach statue room.
         * In the second universe, the player went in as adult, possibly out of logic, and started wasting the keys to lock child out.
         * These Universes converge when the player has 7 keys (meaning adult can no longer lock child out) and adult is known to be able to reach Statue room. This creates "Certain Access", which is tracked seperatly for each age.
         * Child Certain Access is simple, if we have 7 keys and child access, it's Certain Access.
         * Adult Certain Access is also simple, adult is not key locked, so if they make it to a location, it's Certain Access.
         * Things get complicated when we handle the overlap of the 2 universes,
         * though an important detail is that if we have Certain Access as either age, we don't need to checked the overlap because overlap logic is strictly stricter than either Certain Access.

         * In order to track the first universe, the logic allows technical child access with the minimum number of keys, and then checks in this function for if we have 7 keys to determine if that is Certain or not.
         * This is for technical reasons, as areas with no access at all will simply not be checked.
         * Normally we would need to do similar shenanigans to track the second universe, however adult must have go through statue room to waste keys, 
         * so can go back there and get new keys for Child to use if they do, and the navigation logic for shared MQ spirit from Statue Room is very simple for Adult.
         * Additionally, we don't need to know if adult can actually reach spirit temple or climb to statue room, because if the player can't do that, then universe 2 can't happen anyway,
         * and if the player does so out of logic, they can do it again, as the only consumable used sets a permanent flag.

         * The Adult Navigation logic is as such:
         * - Broken Wall room is 6 key locked, because if the player tries to spend 6 keys in a way that would block adults access, they would have to give child access instead.
         * - The child side hammer switch for the time travelling chest is 7 key locked for adult
         * - Reaching gauntlets hand is 7 key locked
         * - Going back into big block room is complex, but the only check there is child only so not a concern
         * - Everything else is possible with basic adult movement, or is impossible for child to reach glitchlessly
         * Anything 7 key locked does not need to be checked as shared, as all child access is Certain and because of this workaround we don't need to fake Adult access, meaning that is also Certain.
         * All of this combined means that when checking if adult can reach a location in universe 2, we only have to ask if it is a 6 key locked location or not.

         * Knowing all of this this, we can confirm things are logical in 3 different ways:
         * - If we have Adult Access, we know it is Certain Access, so they can get checks alone.
         * - If we have 7 keys, child has Certain Access as we know they cannot be locked out, so can get checks alone, otherwise we check the logical overlap
         * - If Child and Adult can get the check (ignoring actual adult access to the location), and the location is either not 6 key locked or we have 6 keys, we can get the check with the overlap
